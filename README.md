- 👋 Hi, I’m @saraiyash, or at least that's what the Internet knows me by.
- 👀 I’m interested in data analytics, Man Utd, community service, and mostly gathering trivia to make myself a better Jeopardy watcher.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, R, SAS, SQL, Tableau, and more data analytics tools.
- :soccer: My dream job(s) are: Director of Football at Man Utd (long term), Data Scientist at Man Utd (short term). 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on football analytics (aka soccer in the US of A)
- 📫 How to reach me? You can email me at saraiyash@tamu.edu or search for @saraiyash on any of the social media platforms.
